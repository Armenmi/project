In addition to regular classes, our school regularly offers additional classes for gifted students in Mathematics, Physics, Computer Science and other subjects, where we show excellent results in numerous competitions. Another advantage of our school is that it is located in a quiet location, surrounded by greenery, which provides students with even better conditions for gathering knowledge.

      <p class="card-text ">The Third High School started its educational work back in 1948 and has been considered one of the better schools in our city ever since. During the years of its existence, it experienced various changes of name and direction. State Lower Real High School, State Incomplete Real High School, State Second Mixed High School, State Fifth High School, then Third High School in Sarajevo, "Braća Ribar" Gymnasium, and "Braća Ribar" School for Secondary Oriented Education and Upbringing are the names that were assigned to it and recorded in the School Yearbook. However, after all the changes, it regained its current name in 1991 and again became our Third High School.</p>
      <p class="card-text ">From 1992 to 1995, our school suffered great losses: school facilities were damaged and property was destroyed. The clock stopped at the entrance to the school building, life stopped and it seemed that it would be no more. The defenders of the city entered the school because the Third Gymnasium was the first line of defense of the city of Sarajevo. We were proud that she served honorably in his defense, but we were also saddened to see her grow old, grow into a weed, and disappear. Those were extremely difficult moments for our school and all those who worked and taught there, and also for those who gathered knowledge and lived the best days of their youth there.</p>

      <p class="card-text ">During the eight years in which classes could not be held at our school, we used the premises of the Agricultural and Veterinary School and the elementary school "Hrasno" for the same purpose, for which we are extremely grateful. And then we continued to spread knowledge, culture and humanity. We didn't give up, we waited for the day to come when our school would be rebuilt and we, like before, would be a part of it again.</p>
      <p class="card-text ">Our dream came true with the help of USAID, the City of Stockholm and the Canton of Sarajevo, which participated and contributed to the reconstruction of the Third High School. Since then, our school has been working at full steam, shines in a new glow and still holds the title of one of the best secondary schools in Sarajevo. We regularly achieve international cooperation by exchanging students and professors with schools in Sweden, Austria, France, Denmark, Switzerland, Germany and other countries.</p>
      <p class="card-text ">"I want this renovated school to be a symbol of our tomorrow," said Bill Clinton on July 30, 1999, when he visited our school, and we are still trying to fulfill his expectations. Regardless of everything our school has been through, it has never stopped being what it has always been: a place full of love, humanity, beautiful memories, knowledge, talents and skills, all thanks to our students, teachers and other employees. If it weren't for them, those who believed in our school, were part of it and filled the pages of its history, it would certainly not be the same school as it is today. We are very proud of her and all our students, teachers and workers, and we are grateful that we continue to create a bright future together for all of us.</p>
